# Project Background:
The Virtual Gym project aims to build an Web app for both Physiotherapists and their patients to assist in exercise. The Physiotherapists will be able to build and upload animations for exercises for the patients to perform. The patients will be able to view, favorite, discuss, and ask questions about the exercises that have been uploaded. In this project, we will also construct the backend to support the application
